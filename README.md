# Data-Analysis
This is a portfolio of data analysis projects that I have worked on in Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
- The `Football_Analysis` folder contains the csv files and code I used to analyze statistics in college football.
- The `Cereal_Analysis` folder contains the csv file and code I used to analyze different traits in popular United States cereals.
